# gta5fov
A fork of the GTA V FoV mod for use with Script Hook V.

(Mostly) Original readme follows...

GTA 5 mod for freely setting fields of view.

This is the developer README. For usage information see README.txt in the GTA5FoV folder.

I don't expect this code to contain much information of interest, but here it is anyway.

Bug reports and pull requests welcome!
